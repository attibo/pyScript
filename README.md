# pyScript
Now it's called Shpy
Simple tool written in in Python language to manage Linux sh script (for example several backup LAN script)
only for Linux. Needs Vim editor installed.
Someone need to manage several GNU Linu sh scripts (for example to perform some backups over the LAN network).
It's useful to employ a simple utility to have at one's fingertips those shell scripts.
Pyscript store full pathnames of sh files in a flat file (catalogo.txt).
You can execute one or more scripts in sequence with a unique command.
It's possible to edit manually the catalog with Vim (this tool need Vim installed).
Pyscript is written in Python language without any GUI interface and so you can launch this simple application in a SSH session.
You can also archive all sh files in a flat file (scriptarch.txt) to avoid a unintentional delete.
Shpy rel. 1.5 news: now it's possibile to manage cifs mountpoint.
In a flat file (cifsarc.txt) you can store parameters for mounting cifs filesystem with a simple command like e.g. "mnn 1"
Sorry, my english is bad but I wanted to share this simple code with more people than possible.
